Today we are thrilled to announce that 2i2c has received core support from the &lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a>. You can find &lt;a href="https://cziscience.medium.com/scaling-open-infrastructure-and-reproducibility-in-biomedicine-69546a399747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZI&amp;rsquo;s announcement here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This funding totals around $1.4m over three years. It provides crucial core support for 2i2c as it bootstraps itself into existence. We are so thankful to CZI for this support. 🎉🙏✨&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of this post is a short run-down of what we&amp;rsquo;ll use this funding for, and what we hope to accomplish.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-big-picture">The big picture&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In recent years, several projects including &lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binder&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syzygy&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Berkeley DataHubs&lt;/a> have built atop the Jupyter architecture to support cloud-based infrastructure for reproducible research, large-scale scientific data analysis, national-scale infrastructure for researchers, and broad-impact educational programs based on freely available computational materials. These projects illustrate the transformative potential of the open Jupyter architecture, but they have also shown that unlocking this potential in service of scientists and educators requires continued development and resources beyond those of open source volunteers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to deploy these resources at scale, manage and maintain them for large communities, and to continue developing the underlying technologies for scientific use cases, we need models to sustainably deploy and improve Jupyter technology. We also need capacity for thinking strategically and forging new partnerships to accomplish this goal. This funding will support 2i2c’s early strategic planning and partnership efforts, as well as technical development and operation of Jupyter infrastructure for research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are two keys goals for this grant:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-1-build-capacity-for-jupyter-in-research-and-education">Goal 1: Build capacity for Jupyter in research and education&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The primary goal of this funding is to build more capacity for Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s engagement in research and education. This funding will primarily support &lt;a href="/author/chris-holdgraf">Chris Holdgraf&lt;/a> to build strategic partnerships and collaborations, find opportunities for Jupyter infrastructure to benefit research and education, coordinate activity in the Jupyter project that benefits these communities, and secure more funding for development, maintenance, and support for Jupyter technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are grateful to CZI for this funding because strategy, leadership, and community support are often difficult to fund from grants that are focused on technical deliverables. By funding strategic growth and capacity building, CZI is helping 2i2c lay a strong foundation from which it can have a greater impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-2-support-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education">Goal 2: Support hosted Jupyter infrastructure for research and education&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c will offer hosted &lt;a href="/infrastructure">interactive computing infrastructure&lt;/a> utilizing the Jupyter ecosystem. It will both deploy and operate this infrastructure for researchers and educators, as well as perform core development to ensure that it serves these communities well. Funding from this grant will support 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s first hire - &lt;a href="/author/georgiana-dolocan">Georgiana Dolocan&lt;/a> as an &lt;strong>Open Source Infrastructure Engineer&lt;/strong>. Georgiana has been the &lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/the-jupyterhub-and-binder-contributor-in-residence-56708d1e3069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub Contributor in Residence&lt;/a> for the past year, and we are so excited for her to join 2i2c!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Georgiana will begin by supporting several pilot hubs that are run by 2i2c for community colleges, universities, and research institutions. She will help these organizations accomplish their mission through 2i2c infrastructure, and will develop these technologies so they are stable, scalable, and serve a diverse set of needs in research and education. This will hopefully set the foundation for 2i2c to sustainably offer this hub infrastructure to a wider audience in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the next step in Georgiana’s journey through the Jupyter ecosystem that began with &lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/outreachy-jupyter-supporting-diversity-in-open-communities-dfa78db4b0bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an outreachy internship&lt;/a> followed by &lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/cir-report-i-1ca418c230cd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a term as Contributor in Residence&lt;/a>. Both of these steps were made possible thanks to Jupyter stakeholders who invest their resources, time, and mentorship to grow Jupyter’s community beyond the people that have traditionally been involved in the project. It’s also possible because of funders committing resources to broaden participation and inclusion - in particular, the &lt;a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkeley Institute for Data Science&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://numfocus.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NumFOCUS&lt;/a> for their original support of our Outreachy interns and the &lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZI EOSS grant series&lt;/a> for funding the original Contributor in Residence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With this core support, 2i2c turns towards its &lt;a href="/infrastructure/#kinds-of-hubs">JupyterHub pilot deployments&lt;/a> to build early prototypes that serve research and education, and to build organizational models that sustain these hubs and their development. If you or your organization think you’d be a good fit for these pilots, please &lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">reach out to 2i2c&lt;/a> and let us know!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks again to CZI for this support - we believe that it is an excellent investment in the Jupyter community and in open source communities more generally. We also believe it will lead to major advancements in supporting interactive computing workflows for research and education. We look forward to what the next three years will bring!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>👋 hey everyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to announce the creation of a new non-profit organization&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> that we call &lt;strong>2i2c&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c stands for &lt;strong>The International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/strong>. It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a short post about why we created 2i2c, what we hope that it will do, and what we are up to next. If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to watch a video instead of read a blog post, check out &lt;a href="https://cfp.jupytercon.com/2020/schedule/presentation/209/2i2c-sustaining-open-source-through-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this talk about 2i2c&lt;/a> at JupyterCon 2020:&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YjonPLxDiwM" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="why-create-2i2c">Why create 2i2c?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The founding team of 2i2c has spent the last several years running projects that use interactive computing for research and education, including &lt;a href="/founders#datahub">bringing data science education to thousands of students&lt;/a>, connecting &lt;a href="/founders#pangeo">geospatial researchers with large datasets and computational resources in the cloud&lt;/a>, and providing &lt;a href="/founders#syzygy">federated online environment hubs to schools across Canada&lt;/a>, to name a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time we realized that, while infrastructure for interactive computing could be a huge benefit to research and education, it also required a fair amount of expertise to configure, deploy, and develop. We wished for other organizations to enjoy the same success that we had found, but learned that for many, deploying their own infrastructure was a non-starter to adoption. Instead, many were turning to proprietary or vendor-specific tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We created 2i2c so that these organizations can use entirely open-source tools without hiring and training their own dev-ops and infrastructure talent, and so that &lt;em>development&lt;/em> and &lt;em>support&lt;/em> of open tools for interactive computing continues to represent the interests of research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-non-profit">Why a non-profit?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It may sound strange to create a non-profit organization when there are many VC-funded startups and large tech companies offering notebook services these days. However, we think that a non-profit organization is the right approach to balance the interests of all the stakeholders that we wish to serve. We hope that 2i2c will be a partner to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research and educational communities&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c to provide them cutting-edge infrastructure for interactive computing that is 💯 open source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Researchers and educators who need development&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c as a collaborator that provides development and expertise in open-source infrastructure to push the cutting edge of interactive computing in the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Open source communities&lt;/strong>, who can count on 2i2c support and grow the communities that underlie the tools that we deploy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud providers&lt;/strong>, who wish to help the research and educational community via their infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supporters of open source&lt;/strong> who wish to support interactive computing for research and education via a non-profit dedicated to exactly this mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a non-profit, 2i2c is dedicated to supporting an ecosystem of tools and stakeholders across the open source community, and to ensuring that those tools are well-suited for research and education. We believe strongly in mission-driven work, and non-profit status will ensure that the work that we do is always aligned with our mission and values.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-going-to-do">What are we going to do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With all of that in mind, what is 2i2c actually going to do? We are still working out the details, but here&amp;rsquo;s a rough picture:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Offer &lt;a href="/infrastructure">&lt;strong>hosted interactive computing environments on cloud infrastructure&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. These will &lt;a href="/right-to-replicate">be entirely open source&lt;/a> and vendor-neutral, and customizable for the communities that are using them. They&amp;rsquo;ll be offered either as a fee-for-service model and/or subsidized through grants and donations. We wish to build upon the success of JupyterHub as a gateway to computational resources and environments, learning environments, and communities of users. For more information about the vision and values of our hosted infrastructure, see &lt;a href="/right-to-replicate">the 2i2c &lt;strong>Right to Replicate&lt;/strong> document&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide &lt;a href="/infrastructure#research-development-hubs">&lt;strong>collaboration and development for interactive computing in research and education&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Beyond providing hub infrastructure, there are many ways in which solving problems in research and education can lead to better tools, infrastructure, and workflows in the open source community. For example - how can we generalize a community&amp;rsquo;s solution to scalable computing so that it can be useful for other use-cases as well? We hope that 2i2c can be an aggregator and integrator of many perspectives in research and education, and build tools that are maximally useful across communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide &lt;a href="/open-source">&lt;strong>core development and community support&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> for open source projects that we use. While many organizations &lt;em>use&lt;/em> Jupyter technology in their projects, it is also crucial that they &lt;em>give back&lt;/em> to those tools in order to keep the ecosystem healthy. As a mission-driven non-profit, 2i2c has a core goal in not only deploying and customizing open source tools, but also providing core support for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="next-steps">Next steps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c is a young organization, but we already have a few exciting ideas to work towards in the coming months. Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be up to next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first step is to &lt;strong>understand how interactive computing can best-serve the research and education communities&lt;/strong>. We know that interactive computing tools work in our specific use-cases, but how do these generalize to other domains or types of organizations? Moreover, how can we improve the open source tools to make them even more customizable for each community?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll begin answering this question through several focused JupyterHub pilots aimed at different use-cases across research and education:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A &amp;ldquo;Hubs for All&amp;rdquo; pilot for education&lt;/strong>. This will focus on making standard educational environments via JupyterHub accessible to a broad range of educational institutions, in particular, traditionally under-resourced institutions such as community colleges, state colleges, and HBCUs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research-focused hubs for earth analytics&lt;/strong>. Research requires more complex and customized infrastructure than education, and so we are piloting hub infrastructure for a few specific research communities to understand how we can meet their needs. We will use this to better-understand how 2i2c and support a diverse research community in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JupyterHub development for the Pangeo Project&lt;/strong>. Pangeo has been a collaborator of 2i2c since day one, and we love its vision for large-scale earth analytics via cloud infrastructure. We plan to work closely with Pangeo leadership to work on early development of tools aimed at facilitating scalable computing for research on Pangeo infrastructure. More information about this to come soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll also use these pilots to &lt;strong>develop an organizational sustainability model&lt;/strong> around this infrastructure. It takes expertise to manage and develop cloud infrastructure, and 2i2c wishes to pay market rates for its engineers. How can 2i2c offer services and development in a way that is sustainable both for itself and for other institutions? We&amp;rsquo;ll use these pilots to create a plan for both sustaining and scaling 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s ability to serve institutions and teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-we-need">What do we need?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a non-profit organization, 2i2c has a long road ahead of it. We cannot take venture capital funding, so we have to raise funds the old-fashioned way. This means that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are at an organization interested in purchasing hosted JupyterHub environments from 2i2c, please &lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are a funder or are otherwise interested in supporting 2i2c with a donation or grant, please &lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have experience in sustaining service-based organizations such as 2i2c, and wish to offer your expertise or guidance, please &lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ll likely be hiring in the coming months for open source engineers, with a focus on data science, interactive computing, and the cloud. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in working for an organization like 2i2c, please &lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>, and keep an eye on this space as we will post more information soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="get-involved">Get involved&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to get involved with the 2i2c team and community, we recommend two pathways for doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdW_bhVrXfgRYa9Ct6w399KQPILbU_3nKUF_tgnGZJbs91SXg/viewform?usp=sf_link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subscribe to our mailing list&lt;/a>. We&amp;rsquo;ll use this to periodically send updates about what 2i2c is up to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://forms.gle/f3rmHZCijK3bYAaA8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Join the 2i2c Slack&lt;/a>. We use Slack for team conversation, as well as for real-time conversations about tools, practices, and ideas around interactive computing for research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also say hello to us on Twitter at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/2i2c_org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@2i2c_org&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are excited about 2i2c, and believe that it is the right kind of organization to create to support research and education, as well as open source communities in interactive computing. The road ahead is a difficult one, but we&amp;rsquo;re confident that we will hit our stride quickly. Stay tuned for more updates to come.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This document describes 2i2c’s commitment to a customer’s “right to replicate”, and how this translates into specific infrastructure commitments from 2i2c. We make these commitments because we believe that using infrastructure that follows these principles will lead to a more fair, just, equitable world. We also believe they are the right foundation for more productive and impactful research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is committed to running its own infrastructure on open-source tools and vendor-agnostic infrastructure, though it does not &lt;em>force&lt;/em> users to use only open-source tools in their own environments, code, and data. Below is a table describing how the Right to Replicate fits into 2i2c hub technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Definitions of &lt;code>MUST&lt;/code>, &lt;code>MUST NOT&lt;/code>, &lt;code>SHOULD&lt;/code>, &lt;code>MAY&lt;/code>, etc are defined in &lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RFC 2119&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;td>User Code and Data&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>May&lt;/strong> be Open Source&lt;/td>
&lt;td>We encourage adopting and producing open source code and data, but this is up to the user. &lt;br /> e.g., licenses for user content/code&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>User Environment&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Should&lt;/strong> be Open Source&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Strong preference for open source tools only, although in some cases user needs may override this. &lt;br /> e.g., Python, R, PyData stack.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2i2c Infrastructure&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Must&lt;/strong> be Open Source&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Strong commitment to using only open source software. &lt;br /> e.g., JupyterHub, Kubernetes, Postgresql&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Cloud Provider Infrastructure&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Must&lt;/strong> be Portable&lt;/td>

&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Below we describe our commitments in our own infrastructure stack in more detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-2i2c-infrastructure-ensures-this-right">How 2i2c infrastructure ensures this right&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c infrastructure and documentation for it MUST BE as transparent &amp;amp; accessible as possible, so customers can replicate our configuration without having to extract any ‘secret sauce’ from 2i2c. If they choose to, they can also inspect, audit &amp;amp; modify the infrastructure they are paying for and using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure the Right to Replicate to our customers, 2i2c makes the following commitments to infrastructure we build and operate:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We MUST use only open source software to run our infrastructure. By only using software that is available to everyone on the same terms, we can ensure that customers can replicate the infrastructure without having to negotiate licensing terms with proprietary software vendors. In addition, any changes we make to open source software will be made in public and/or contributed upstream, so customers continue to have access to them regardless of where their infrastructure is.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We MUST NOT directly depend on proprietary cloud vendor specific products or APIs. Instead, we use cloud-managed open source software, or hide the dependency behind a layer of abstraction. This ensures that customers can port their infrastructure to any cloud provider of their choice, or run it on their own hardware with purely open source software.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This set of commitments acts as a business continuity plan for our customers, ensuring 2i2c will follow best practices within the open source, open education and open research ecosystems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2i2c Hubs</title><link>/infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/infrastructure/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About 2i2c</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Careers at 2i2c</title><link>/careers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/careers/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="open-positions">Open positions&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="why-2i2c">Why 2i2c?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c believes that open infrastructure is a crucial part of transforming research and education to be more powerful, more equitable, more inclusive, and more accessible. We are a small and growing team, and recognize that our early employees play a crucial role in setting the right culture and direction for the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few reasons that we think 2i2c is a fantastic team to work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-values-and-our-mission-drive-our-actions-">Our values and our mission drive our actions 🧭&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>2i2c believes in weaving our set of core values into everything that we do, and that this will guide 2i2c in being as impactful as possible. As a member of 2i2c’s team, you’ll have an opportunity to participate in &lt;a href="/about">a community that believes in these values&lt;/a>, and tries to make the world a better place through living them every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-have-great-team-culture-">We have great team culture 🙌&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>2i2c draws from experience in many large open source communities over the years. Because these communities operate fully remotely and strive to be as inclusive and participatory as possible, they must also strive to be more transparent and systematic in how they communicate, share information, and work. We are building a culture at 2i2c that follows these principles and builds upon them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-have-competitive-pay-and-great-benefits-">We have competitive pay and great benefits 📊&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>2i2c believes that it&amp;rsquo;s important for non-profit work to pay competitively with the tech industry. See &lt;a href="#salaries-and-benefits">more information on our salaries and compensation&lt;/a>. We are also a remote-first organization with team practices that can be spread across the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-support-research-and-education-">We support research and education 🔬&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>All of the work we do at 2i2c feeds into our mission: to support research and education through interactive computing infrastructure. Being a part of the 2i2c team means that each day you will spend your time building, operating, and supporting the infrastructure that powers data-driven discovery and learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="open-source-communities-are-in-our-dna-">Open source communities are in our DNA 🤝&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>All of the technical development that we do is open source, usually in partnership with other open source communities rather than controlled entirely by 2i2c. This means that the work you do with 2i2c will benefit a much broader community, and you’ll be encouraged to connect with other open source communities as you do your work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="salaries-and-benefits">Salaries and benefits&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We pay competitive salaries for all of our employees at SF market rates. 2i2c chooses its salary levels based on job title and discrete levels that correspond to experience. These salaries are fixed and consistent across all employees of 2i2c &amp;ndash; we do not pay different amounts based on geographic location or cost-of-living, you will be paid the same regardless of where you live. 2i2c also offers a generous benefits package, or will provide extra compensation if you are not in a position to take advantage of US-based benefits packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why approach salaries in this way? For a few reasons. First, we don’t believe that people should have to take a large pay-cut just to work at a non-profit organization, and we want to hire competitively for the tech industry. Second, we believe in equal pay for equal work. We don’t believe that your ability to help 2i2c accomplish its mission is impacted by your ability to negotiate a better salary. We also don’t think it is impacted by external factors like your geographical location or cost of living. Third, we believe in transparency and openness when it comes to our salaries, in order to balance the amount of information on both sides of the hiring equation. We think that these practices allow 2i2c to hire competitively, equitably, and successfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-benefits">Our benefits&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>RETIREMENT&lt;/strong>
We have established a qualified, defined contribution retirement plan. We make monthly plan contributions on behalf of each participant equal to 10% or 3% of the eligible employee’s monthly compensation, depending on the employee&amp;rsquo;s appointment type. Most employee types qualify for the 10% contribution. Contributions are fully vested and are not dependent upon the employee making contributions on their own, ie, this is not an employer &amp;ldquo;match&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PAID TIME OFF&lt;/strong>: Vacation, Sick, and Holiday leave
We offer generous vacation and sick leave accrual. We observe 9 holidays throughout the year &lt;em>plus&lt;/em> Thanksgiving and a 2-week paid Winter Break holiday during the last two weeks of December.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>HEALTH&lt;/strong>: Medical, Dental, and Vision
We offer excellent medical options and coverage. Employees may choose from three medical plans (two HMOs, one PPO). Our dental and vision plans are comprehensive and accepted widely by dental and vision care providers. We full cover the cost of plan premiums.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also provide Life and Long-Term Disability Insurance, and employees may opt to participate in our Tax-deferred Annuity Plan and Flexible Spending Account as a way to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for long term savings, medical or dependent care.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where applicable, if you are located outside of the United States, we will work with you to get similar benefits according to your geographical context.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open Source</title><link>/open-source/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/open-source/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Our Founding Team</title><link>/founders/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/founders/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
