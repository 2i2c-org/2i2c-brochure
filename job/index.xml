This engineer will lead the development and operation of cloud-based infrastructure, focusing on the &lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo Project&lt;/a> - a community platform for big data geoscience.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Location&lt;/strong>: Anywhere - this is a fully-remote position.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Position&lt;/strong>: Full-time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Salary&lt;/strong>: $110,000-130,000 + benefits&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c is a non-profit organization with a mission to make interactive computing more accessible, scalable, and powerful for research and education. We strive to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Support data workflows in research and education through infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support open tools and communities that underlie this infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We accomplish this mission by providing managed cloud services for interactive computing, by providing development and technical leadership to researchers and educators that utilize this infrastructure for specific communities, and by providing support for open source tools and communities in this ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have deep ties to the open source community, and have been leaders and core contributors across dozens of projects - in particular in the Jupyter ecosystem. We also have deep ties to research and education - our team has spent years deploying infrastructure for universities, community colleges, and research teams, and now we’re bringing this experience to a wider audience with 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe strongly in communities that are inclusive, transparent, equitable, effective, and diverse, especially 2i2c itself. We believe that our values should permeate everything about 2i2c, including the work we do, the communities we serve, and our own organizational culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is a project of the &lt;a href="https://icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Computer Science Institute&lt;/a>, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-youll-do">What you’ll do&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will define the overall strategy and technical approach to cloud computing usage in Pangeo, and will interface with the Pangeo community on a frequent basis. You will help deploy, customize, and operate cloud infrastructure for research and interactive computing. You&amp;rsquo;ll use the experience operating this infrastructure to identify development opportunities, with the goal of minimizing maintenance time and toil - your goal will be to spend &lt;em>more time developing&lt;/em> and &lt;em>less time operating&lt;/em>. You will contribute to the general development and maintenance of open source software packages for the advancement of scientific objectives, and develop applications for extracting, transforming, loading, managing, and cataloging scientific data in the cloud. You will engage and interact with open source communities surrounding the tools that you use in serving the Pangeo community, and will represent 2i2c in these engagements. You will also collaborate with scientists to support research projects, and may conduct some education and training around scientific computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Develops strategy and technical design for cloud computing architecture within the Pangeo project and related projects with 2i2c.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Explores emerging technologies in the cloud / DevOps space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Travels to conferences and workshops (once COVID-19 restrictions end).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Will work with minimal supervision from leadership at 2i2c in partnership with collaborators at Columbia and the Pangeo project. Will work independently and make their own decisions about where to best allocate effort.&lt;/li>
