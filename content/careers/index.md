## Why 2i2c?

2i2c believes that open infrastructure is a crucial part of transforming research and education to be more powerful, more equitable, more inclusive, and more accessible. We seek fellow mission-driven teammates who have a passion for the collective good, the open source community, and research and education.

- Our values and our mission drive our actions
  - We believe that values and mission are the foundation of an organization, and these define the impact that we wish to create for the world and our community.
- Open source communities are in our DNA
  - 2i2c has deep ties with open source communities, and we work in partnership with these communities for all of the work that we do.
- We support research and education
  - Your work will directly benefit communities that are creating, sharing, and teaching for the sake of the public good.
- Great benefits and culture
  - We are a flexible, remote-friendly, team with a culture of openness, inclusion, and a love of open source.

## A mission- and values-driven organization

2i2c is primarily a mission-driven organization that believes in weaving our set of core values into everything that we do. We believe that this will guide 2i2c in being as impactful as possible. As a member of 2i2c’s team, you’ll have an opportunity to participate in a community that believes in these values, and tries to make the world a better place through living them every day.

## A remote-first team

We are primarily a remote organization. While it has its organizational home in Berkeley, California, 2i2c treats its online spaces as its “primary” office-space. This is partially drawn from our experience in many open source communities over the years. Because these communities operate fully remotely, they must also strive to be more transparent and systematic in how they communicate, share information, and work. We also think this helps them be more inclusive, equitable, and productive, all of which are qualities we strive for at 2i2c.

## Supporting research and education

All of the work we do at 2i2c supports our mission: to support research and education through interactive computing infrastructure. Being a part of the 2i2c team means that each day you will spend your time building, operating, and supporting the infrastructure that powers data-driven discovery and learning. Oh, you’ll do all of this while working entirely with open source software and communities.

## Supporting open source

All of the technical development that we do is open source, usually in partnership with other open source communities rather than controlled entirely by 2i2c. This means that the work you do with 2i2c will benefit a much broader community, and you’ll be encouraged to connect with other open source communities as you do your work.
