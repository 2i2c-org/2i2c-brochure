# Benefits of using open infrastructure

Using open infrastructure has several advantages:

- Open tools are the most **powerful, flexible, and dynamic** tools for learning, research,
  and collaboration.
- Open tools give you the freedom to **run on many kinds of infrastructure**. They can
  provide quick access to fast environments, large datasets, or high-powered compute.
- Open tools **avoid vendor lock-in** - JupyterHub can be deployed anywhere, by anyone.
  The stack it powers can run on a variety of vendor infrastructure, or your own
  computer. You can run the entire 2i2c stack on your own if you wish!
- Open tools are **standards in data science**. They are ubiquitous across academia and industry,
  and using them will help you connect with the broader research and education community.
- Open tools align with the **values of research and education**. They rely on contributions
  from a broad, diverse, and large OS community that is made up of many stakeholders
  dedicated to creating public goods.
- Open tools make research and education **more accessible to all**

2i2c integrates an entirely open stack with hosted infrastructure that is tailored for research and
education, running in the cloud infrastructure of your choice. It also contributes
back to the communities that develop and grow these tools, keeping the ecosystem
healthy.
