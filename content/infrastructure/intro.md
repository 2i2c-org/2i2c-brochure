2i2c Hubs are hosted interactive computing environments that run in the cloud and are powered by entirely open-source technology. They are flexible, customizable, powerful, and can run on a variety of cloud infrastructure. They are designed to accelerate research, enhance education, and promote collaboration. They also give you full control over your infrastructure.

<p class="highlight">2i2c believes that transformational science and education should be built on open-source, community-driven, vendor-agnostic tools.

## 2i2c Hubs are controlled by their community

2i2c's goal is to serve research and educational communities with their own interactive computing infrastructure running in the cloud. This means that all 2i2c Hubs...

- Can be run on a variety of cloud infrastructure - even on your own cloud accounts.
- Run entirely open source tools and standards - you can take your workflows wherever you wish.
- Are customizable for your community - provide the libraries, datasets, cloud connections, and resources that fit your need.
- Are scalable and robust - the technology behind our hubs has been served for communities as small as 2 and as large as 10,000 over the years.
- Are yours to control - manage your hub yourself or even move it to another provider - you control your infrastructure.
