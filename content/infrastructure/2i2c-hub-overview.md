# What is in a 2i2c managed JupyterHub?

A 2i2c managed JupyterHub is a collection of open source tools that provide interactive computing environments in the cloud. JupyterHub is the lynch-pin that ties everything together. It handles user accounts, provides the interactive environment, and connects users with computational and data resources.

Every 2i2c managed JupyterHub is tailored for the community that uses it. 2i2c managed JupyterHubs can run on almost
any kind of cloud infrastructure (or even your own local hardware), provide a
customizable environment for your needs, and they are built with 100% open source and
community-driven software.

2i2c believes in each user's [Right to Replicate](/right-to-replicate) their
infrastructure. This means being able to replicate your entire cloud deployment with or
without 2i2c.

For more information about the 2i2c managed JupyterHubs, see [the 2i2c managed JupyterHubs Pilot documentation](https://2i2c.org/pilot/infrastructure.html).
