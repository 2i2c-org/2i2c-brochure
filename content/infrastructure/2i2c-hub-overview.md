# What is a 2i2c Managed JupyterHub?

A 2i2c Managed JupyterHub is a collection of open source tools that provide interactive computing environments in the cloud. [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/) is the lynch-pin that ties everything together. It handles user accounts, provides the interactive environment, and connects users with computational and data resources.

2i2c **designs distributions of JupyterHub** that are created for research and education. It does this in partnership with others in the research and education community, to ensure that the infrastructure serves their needs and reflects their values. These JupyterHub distributions can run on almost any kind of cloud infrastructure (or even your own local hardware) and are entirely community-driven and open source.

2i2c also **manages JupyterHub distributions** on behalf of others in research and education, as a service. This allows researchers and educators to access the best technology for interactive data science, without managing their own cloud infrastructure.

2i2c believes in each user's [Right to Replicate](/right-to-replicate) their
infrastructure. All 2i2c infrastructure is community-supported and open source, and we follow community-vetted best practices in deploying the infrastructure. If you wish to stop using 2i2c, we wish to empower you to replicate and manage your entire cloud deployment on your own, with or without 2i2c.

For more information about the 2i2c Hubs, see [the 2i2c Hubs Pilot documentation](https://2i2c.org/pilot/about/infrastructure.html).
