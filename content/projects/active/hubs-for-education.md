The Hubs for Education pilot is an attempt at making interactive computing environments more accessible to the research and education community, with a focus on smaller colleges and minority-serving institutions. It is a collaboration between [CloudBank](https://www.cloudbank.org/), the [Berkeley Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/dsep), and 2i2c. 2i2c provides development and management of JupyterHub infrastructure geared towards educational use-cases, in partnership with these collaborators.
